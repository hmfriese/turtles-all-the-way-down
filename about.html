    <h2>Our Contexts</h2>
</div>

<p>LIS 598: Indigenous Contexts in Librarianship course is offered through the School of Library and Information Studies at the University of Alberta. Its aim is to examine the library’s relationality and intersectionality with Indigenous Peoples and Ways of Knowing. Our final project was to create an online publication that dealt with concepts of the Land and book recommendations in libraries. Though books are often considered to be atemporal, we present our booklist as a map in order to highlight the interconnectedness of the stories, their authors, and the Land.</p>
