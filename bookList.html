    <p>This list of books by Indigenous authors is informed by our own shelves. This reading list is not representative of the sum of Indigenous Peoples who are writing and contributing to literature in “Canada.” Rather, this is a starting point for considering Indigenous stories and how we can begin to rethink the relationship between stories, authors and the Land.</p>

    <p>Many of these works deal with sensitive or mature content.</p>
