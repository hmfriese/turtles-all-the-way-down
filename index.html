</div>

<p>All stories have places, but all places also have stories. This project aims to connect stories to their places through an interactive map that highglights both Indigenous Land claims through Treaty maps, and Indigenous written literatures and/or books.</p>

<p>While we recognize that Indigenous relationships to the Land are both sacred and not constrained by the geographic boundaries that the numbered Treaties represent, we would like to suggest this map as a way to think about the relationships and backgrounds of Indigenous authors across the Land now called "Canada."</p>

	<h2>Mapping and Indigenous Perspectives</h2>
</div>

<p>
	Maps are little more than flattened, minified representations of a particular person’s ideas about a particular area. In practice though, maps can make real the representations they present. This reification has resulted in the mass disenfranchisement of Indigenous Peoples on Turtle Island, Aotearoa/New Zealand, and other Indigenous Lands the world over<sup><a href=ref.html#noteTwo”>2</a></sup>. In many ways mapping remains a tool of colonialism and power.<sup><a href=ref.html#noteThree”>3</a></sup> <sup><a href=ref.html#noteFour”>4</a></sup>. However, by mapping Indigenous narratives about place and space, mapping can be used as a tool to unsettle settler colonial narratives about a place.<sup><a href=ref.html#noteFive”>5</a></sup> Mapped Indigenous narratives and World Views can provide a different perspective and means to push back against colonialism. 
</p>

<p>
	This map ties Indigenous authors and their books to a specific latitude and longitude that we deemed to be a good approximation of the geographic contents of their biographies and stories. However, lives and stories are not lived in only one space. No one author or book is truly associated with a single coordinate point. Each of our individual lives and stories are lived both in and influenced by many spaces. Moreover, Indigenous relationships to the Land are not so easily tied to one specific geographical boundary. 
</p>

<div class="heading1">
	<h2>Contextualizing Labels</h2>
</div>

<p>
	We have chosen to represent this map with only the Treaties as they are recognized by the government of “Canada.” You will find no other geopolitical boundaries, names, or labelling of any kind. Instead, you will find the name and date of signing for each of the Treaties and the names and contexts for the stories and authors we have chosen to represent. This offers an alternative perspective to the more common colonial maps and their state imposed boundaries. The two groups of Treaties that we have mapped are the pre-1975 Numbered Treaties<sup><a href=ref.html#noteSix”>6</a></sup> and the post-1975 Treaties<sup><a href=ref.html#noteSeven”>7</a></sup>. These “Treaties are negotiated agreements that define the rights, responsibilities and relationships between” select Indigenous Peoples and the “Canadian” and provincial governments.<sup><a href=ref.html#noteEight”>8</a></sup> While these Treaty relationships define an important agreement between Indigenous Peoples and the government, not all Indigenous Peoples in Canada are party to Treaty agreements. Put differently, this is an inconsistent way to think about Land. Not being party to a Treaty agreement does not make an Indigenous group less entitled to their traditional territories.
</p>

<div class="heading1">
	<h2>Why This in a Library School?</h2>
</div>

<p>
	In mapping these stories and authors we have attempted to provide a spatial context that facilitates visualisation. Each of these individual works stand on their own as important depictions of the lives and experiences of Indigenous Peoples. As a mapped collection or reading list, there is the possibility to provide spatial context to an already rich narrative.
</p>

<p>
	As professionals and as an institution with a responsibility for storing and providing access to information equitably, it is important that librarians and libraries recognize the significance of representing collections within their contexts. One of these contexts is their geographies. To be sure, this spatial contextualization is not a scalable project for whole collections. Rather, this approach to a mapped collection is a different way of thinking about the contexts that are inherent in all collections.
